![Pika Screenshot](/images/work/show/pika-preview.png)

Created Pika to quickly generate shareable screenshots
from boring screenshots. Previous workflow included
involvement of Figma in which I had to open the app
and then figure out the background gradient and shadows etc.

Here's how it works:

- You just paste your screenshot
- Customize the screenshot, add background, shadow etc.
- Copy the output image, or save it as PNG on your machine

Pika saves your previous settings so when you load it again,
it'll retain your last settings.

Pika is open-source and 
the [code is available at Github](http://github.com/rishimohan/pika).

**Update (September 07, 2022)**

- To increase the scope of what Pika can do, 
I've added [mockup templates](https://pika.style/templates)
which will let users design mockups for various use cases,
for e.g [App Store template](https://pika.style/templates/mobile-app/app-store-play-store-screenshot) 
to design screenshots for App Store pages, 
or [code to image template](https://pika.style/templates/web/code-image) 
to create shareable images from code snippets
- Templates will also help in getting diverse organic traffic
since it'll target very specific keywords
- To achieve Templates, I've rewritten major chunk of
components that can be used commonly along
all the templates

**Update (April 18, 2022)**

- Added a new tool in Pika to 
[generate Open Graph and marketing images](https://pika.style/open-graph-generator)
